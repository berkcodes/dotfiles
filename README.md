## Extensions, Themes, Tweaks, etc
For themes, I switch between Adwaita and [Arc](https://github.com/arc-design/arc-theme). For the icons, I am currently using [Paprius](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme).

As for extensions, I only use three at the moment.

* Dash to Panel
* User Themes
* Sound Input & Output Device Chooser

I've also bound my caps-lock key to escape using the GNOME Tweaks app.

## BASH and Vim

* To use `.vimrc` and `.bashrc` files, place them in your home folder.

## What is gtk.css?

This file modifies the padding found in GNOME terminal by 10 pixels. Place this in your `~/.config/gtk-3.0/` directory if you want to use it.

# weechat
Simply replace your existing `weechat.conf` and `buflist.conf` files with the ones I've provided. If you're running a Debian/Ubuntu based system, you may run into a certificate error. I'll provide a solution to that soon.
