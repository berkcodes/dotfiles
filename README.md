## Extensions, Themes, Tweaks, etc

After trying out dozens of themes, I finally embraced Adwaita. As for my shell theme, I'm using the dark variant of [Adementary](https://github.com/hrdwrrsk/adementary-theme). For the icons, I am currently using [Paprius](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme).

As for extensions, I only use three at the moment.

* User Themes
* Dash to Panel
* Sound Input & Output Device Chooser
* Topicons Plus

I've also bound my caps-lock key to escape using the GNOME Tweaks app.

## BASH and Vim

* To use `.vimrc` and `.bashrc` files, place them in your home folder.

## What is gtk.css?

This file modifies the padding found in GNOME terminal by 10 pixels. Place this in your `~/.config/gtk-3.0/` directory if you want to use it.

## Hints to my workflow!

You may notice that I only have one window toggle, that is because I mainly use keyboard shortcuts to close, maximise and minimise my windows. If I ever want to use the titlebar, I use middle-click to minimise and double-click to maximise.
