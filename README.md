## gtk.css?
This file modifies the padding found in GNOME terminal by 10 pixels. Place this in your `~/.config/gtk-3.0/` directory if you want to use it.

# ufetch
Displays system info in a fancy way with some customisations. Original one can be found [here.](https://gitlab.com/jschx/ufetch/)

# weechat
Simply replace your existing `weechat.conf` and `buflist.conf` files with the ones I've provided. If you're running a Debian/Ubuntu based system, you may run into a certificate error. I'll provide a solution to that soon.
